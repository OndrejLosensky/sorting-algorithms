# Sorting algorithms

Repository with sorting algorithms showcase. Each of them has *simple version* & *vizual with video*. Each sorting algorithm also has log.txt file that shows time taken for it to sort the list and etc.
### Sorting time (Simple.py): number of elements in the list
Algorithm |100| 1000| 10 000 | 100 000 | 1 000 000 | 10 000 000 | 25 000 000 
--- | --- | --- | --- |--- |--- |--- |---
Bubblesort | 0.000713s | 0.0629s | 6.4593s | - | - | - | - |
Insertsort | 0.000507s | 0.0305s | 3.3144s | - | - | - | - | 
Selectsort | 0.000964s | 0.0459s | 4.1169s | - | - | - | - |
Mergesort  | 0.000768s | 0.008s  | 0.0811s | 0.9293s | 11.29s | 141.37s | - |
Quicksort  | 0.00062s  | 0.0051s | 0.0645s | 0.6121s | 7.89s  | 83.56s  | 423.68s |
Heapsort   | 0.001116s | 0.0129s | 0.1809s | 2.2778s | 31.28s | 407.98s | - |
Radixsort  | 0.001137s | 0.0062s | 0.0788s | 1.2946s | 13.05s | 166.52s | - | 

### Sorting time with input from txt file (Input.py): number of ID's inside the file
Algorithm |100| 1000| 10 000 | 100 000 | 1 000 000 
--- | --- | --- | --- |--- |--- 
Bubblesort | -| - | - | - | - |
Insertsort | - | - | - | - | - |
Selectsort | - | - | - | - | - | 
Mergesort | - | - | - | - | - | 
Quicksort | - | - | - | - | - | 
Heapsort | - | - | -| - | - | 

*input.txt with ID's is generated randomly just for the algorithm to have something to work with*

## How to install
*create new virtual envirorment for packages*
```
python3 -m venv myEnv
```

*activate it by typing this into terminal:*
```
source venv/bin/activate   
```

*install those modules for it to work:*
```
pip install matplotlib ipython
```
