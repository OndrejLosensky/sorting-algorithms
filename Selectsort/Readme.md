# Select sort
Selection sort is a simple sorting algorithm that works by repeatedly finding the minimum (or maximum) element from the unsorted part of the array and swapping it with the first unsorted element. This process is repeated until the entire array is sorted.

### Efficiency
Selection sort is efficient for sorting small arrays or lists where simplicity is preferred over efficiency. It has a time complexity of **O(n^2)** for both average and worst-case scenarios, making it less efficient than more advanced sorting algorithms like merge sort or quicksort. However, it may be suitable for sorting small datasets or teaching purposes due to its simplicity and ease of implementation.

### Time taken in test:
List of 1000 numbers placed randomly: **0.0459s**   
List of 10 000 numbers placed randomly: **0.0788s**
