# Insert sort
Insertion sort is a simple sorting algorithm that builds the final sorted array one element at a time. It iterates through the input array, removing one element at a time and placing it in its correct position in the sorted part of the array. It continues this process until all elements are sorted.

### Efficiency
Insertion sort is efficient for sorting small arrays or lists, particularly when the data is nearly sorted or the array is already partially sorted. It also performs well in scenarios where the overhead of more complex algorithms might outweigh the benefits, such as sorting small datasets or lists with a small number of elements.


### Time taken in test:
List of 1000 numbers placed randomly: **0.0305s**  
List of 10 000 numbers placed randomly: **3.3144s**
