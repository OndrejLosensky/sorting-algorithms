# Bubble sort
Bubble sort is a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. It continues this process until the entire list is sorted.

### Efficiency
Bubble sort is efficient for sorting small lists or lists that are nearly sorted. However, it is not efficient for large lists or lists with a random order, as its time complexity is O(n^2), making it slower compared to more advanced sorting algorithms like merge sort or quicksort.

### Time taken (Simple.py):
List of 1000 numbers placed randomly: **0.0629s**  
List of 10 000 numbers placed randomly: **6.4593s**

### Time taken with .txt file (Input.py):
Text file with 10 000 10-digit long ID's: ****
